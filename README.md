## 🔍 Overview

The **Zero Trust Network Simulator** is a **virtualized network lab environment** designed to simulate **micro-segmented networks, strict access policies, and zero trust principles.**  
It enables cybersecurity teams to test and validate **Zero Trust architectures (ZTA)** across various use cases in a controlled lab.

Built for **SOC teams, network architects, and security researchers**, the simulator helps evaluate access control mechanisms, policy enforcement, and trust boundary violations.

## ⚙️ Key Features

- 🖧 **Micro-Segmentation:** Simulates network segments and isolated VLANs.
- 🔐 **Policy-Based Access Control:** Emulates Zero Trust access flows between assets.
- 🚀 **Attack Simulation:** Launches controlled attacks to test segmentation effectiveness.
- 🔍 **Access Validation:** Verifies identity-based and context-based access controls.
- 🛠️ **Virtualized Environment:** Easily deployable on VMware, VirtualBox, or cloud labs.

## 🛡️ Use Cases

| Scenario                     | Description                                                     |
|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| Zero Trust Architecture Labs  | Build and test Zero Trust network configurations.              |
| SOC Training Environments     | Train blue teams on identifying lateral movement attempts.    |
| Secure Network Design Testing | Validate segmentation before deployment in production.         |
| Access Policy Verification    | Ensure users and services only access what they are allowed.  |

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python 3.x (or Bash) for automation
- Virtualized Linux/Windows environments
- iptables / nftables for network segmentation
- OpenVPN / WireGuard for encrypted tunnels
- Docker Compose / Ansible (optional lab deployment)

## 🚫 Why Code is Confidential?

The lab contains **custom attack scripts and segmentation bypass scenarios** that could be misused to simulate unauthorized access in real networks.  
Access is restricted to legitimate Zero Trust evaluations.
